Duke ECE 565: Performance	Optimization & Parallelism 

## Course	Summary
This	course	focuses	on	analyzing	and	optimizing	the	performance	of	software,	in	both	a	
single-threaded	and	multi-threaded	setting.	Students	will	apply	their	knowledge	of	
hardware,	programming,	and	assembly	to	both	tasks,	and	thus	a	strong	background	in	
all	three	topics	is	required.	Single-threaded	performance	will	include	topics	such	as	code	
profiling	and	analysis,	loop	transformation,	analysis	of	the	interaction	of	the	code	and	
the	memory	hierarchy,	and	assembly	level	instruction	scheduling	impacts.	Multithreaded	topics	will	include	topics	such	as	scalability	and	load	balance.

## Topics
- Loop	transformations	and	optimizations
- Software	pipelining
- Cache	performance	(how	code	interacts	with	the	cache	&	memory	hierarchy)
- Code	profiling
- Performance	counters
- Parallelism	&	Amdahl's	Law
- Parallel	programming	models
- Shared	memory	parallel	programming	for	performance	and	scalability
- OpenMP
- Synchronization
- User-level	thread	libraries	(C++	thread,	pthreads,	etc.)
- Memory	Consistency
- Lock-free	Data	Structures
- Cluster	programming
- Directives	for	GPU	programming

## Assignments
The	following	reflects the	breakdown	of	graded	components	of	the	course,	as	well	as	
tentative	due	dates	(they	are	subject	to	shift	slightly).		Note	that	some	assignments	will	
be	completed	in	groups.		Unless	explicitly	denoted	as	a	group	assignment,	all	work	is	
expected	to	be	done	individually.
### Programming	+	Written	Problems	(Totally 5):	55%
1. Single-threaded	performance	and	loop	transformations
2. Cache	and	memory	system	performance
3. Performance	profiling,	analysis	and	tuning
4. Loop-level	parallelism;	parallelism	using	OpenMP
5. Scalable	parallel	performance;	manual	threading	(e.g.	pthreads)
